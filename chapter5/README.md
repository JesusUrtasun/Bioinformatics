This tutorial has 3 parts:

**1)** Descriptive statistics for single variable and multivariable datasets including measures of central tendency, variability and quantiles, along with distributions, the Central Limit Theorem and confidence interval for the mean.

**2)** Hypothesis testing in the form of 2-samples comparison (the t-test, non-parametric test) and correlation tests (parametric and non-parametric)

**3)** Linear regression analysis
