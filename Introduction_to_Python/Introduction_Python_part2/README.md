# Note

This weeks learning material is very comprehensive and if you have the time you should read it all but the main section to focus on this week is Pandas. Pay particular attention to how to explore the data, index dataframes, create and drop rows/columns, and input/output files. The rest of the material can be looked up in the pandas documentation as and when required.

 If there is something that you need to do with a dataframe, it is almost guaranteed that it can be done with Pandas, so this weeks material is by no means a fully comprehensive guide to all that can be done in Pandas.

Next week is visualisation and the main thing which will help you visualise your data is if you are able to explore, clean up, and manipulate your dataframes.

List/tuple indexing notation
